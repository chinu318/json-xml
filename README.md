Our team believes that the file that would be easier for a human to use is the CSV file because it can be converted to an Excel file, and does not contain as much noise (i.e. curly brackets, tags).

On the other hand, we believe that the JSON file would be easier for a computer to use because it is more lightweight than XML, can be parsed faster than XML, and can be loaded asynchronously.
